			<h2>What's going on?</h2>
			<p>Every 109 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. And every 8 minutes, that victim is a child. </p>
			<p>1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. About 3% of American men—or 1 in 33—have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. </p>
			<p>94% of women who are raped experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the two weeks following the rape. </p>

					When sexual assault victims seek medical attention and rape kits are performed, nearly every article of clothing a victim wears into the emergency room is taken for evidence.

			<p>Sometimes survivors lose an item of clothing with sentimental value, or if the survivor is from a low socioeconomic background, they may lose their only pair of jeans. Once clothing has been surrendered, the traumatized victim has nothing else to wear home but a hospital gown…only adding insult to injury. That's how rape makes you feel. Dirty. Sexual assault survivors shouldn’t have to leave the hospital wearing a sheet.</p>

			<h2>What can I do?</h2>
			<p>Together, with your help, we can provide victims with the resources necessary to take the first step on the road to healing. Help restore dignity to survivors of sexual assault by donating to Healing Hamper. </p>
            <p>Funds will be used to purchase new clothing that will stock clothing closets at SART (Sexual Assault Response Team) locations in the greater Chicago area. Highly trained medical advocates are on call 24 hours a day to provide in-person crisis support to survivors of sexual assault and abuse at 14 hospitals located in Chicago. The advocates help with immediate needs and will be able to provide victims with clothing to wear home from the hospital after their examination.</p>
